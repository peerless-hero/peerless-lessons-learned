My project is open source and hosted on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/peerless_hero/peerless-lessons-learned) Source code cloned from [stroverse-i18n](https://github.com/isooosi/astroverse-i18n).

## Why is the website project open source?

-The website itself is in pure document form, without any hidden content.
