## Website Introduction

The framework used is vue3, the packaging and building tool is rspack, and the website is hosted using Cloudflare's pages service.

## Project Idea

1. Use vue3 and rspack to build a static website and host the code on GitHub.
2. Generate images using tools like Stable Diffusion web UI and place the images in the GitHub repository.
3. Deploy the website using Cloudflare's pages service.

## Why Do This

It's like using a git repository as a gallery. Cloudflare's pages service is completely free for static services, and the access speed in China is acceptable.
